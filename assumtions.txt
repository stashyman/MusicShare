Assumptions:

We assume that a username will not be read in on the file twice.
We assume that all friend relationships being read in on the file are mutual.
We assume that songs can be duplicated.
We assume that all of a user's messages (song requests, friend requests) will remain active until the program is killed.
We assume that you cannot interact with any user than has not logged in.
We assume that the user will read in a number when the UI prompts for a number. (It doesn't necessarily have to be a correct number though)
