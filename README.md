To start the program, run ClientProg.java and pass in the txt file with the data as the only parameter.
Once the correct .txt file has been inputed and trying to log in to the program, you must enter the correct Username and Password in order to get into the main program.
Once you are in the UI, you need to follow the instructions as prompted by the program exactly. By this I mean you need proper capitalization and punctuation.
The first menu options describe all of the things that the sub menu options do, and then the sub menu options will take care of the use cases.
If you want to send messages to someone else, then they also need to be logged in. To log someone else in, you need to use menu option 8 and use the Log In function. Once someone lese is logged in, you can then use menu option 7 to switch to them.
