Problems to addressed

1: Implement borrowed songs (need to add to playable library and implement checking to send them back)
2: playlist (add songs from owned library to playlists (also check if borrowed and don't allow to play if so)
3: library sorting setting (changing profile setting) (Ben is in the process of geting this to work)
4: We need to move the functionality of borrowing a song from option 5 (send message) to option 3 (borrow a song)
5: need to impliment taking back a song that has been lent
6: library sorting (actually sorting the songs) (Ben is in the process of geting this to work)
7: song visability (profile option to allow songs to be frinds only or public browsing)
8: being able to change the borrow length, and be either time in minutes or num plays (in profile seetings)
9: Library searching (we have by single friend working, but need to impliment by all friends and by public)
